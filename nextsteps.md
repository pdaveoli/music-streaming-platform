Based on the project so far, you have a solid foundation with authentication, a persistent player, playlists, and a library. Here are some new features you could add to take it to the next level:



- User Profiles: Expand the existing user profiles to be public (optional). Users could see each other's favorite playlists or recently played tracks.
- Follow System: Allow users to follow each other or follow artists to get updates.
- Collaborative Playlists: Enable a feature where multiple users can add songs to a single playlist.


- Content Discovery: "For You" or "Discover" Page: Create a page with personalized recommendations. This could start simply by showing "Recently Added" albums or "Trending" tracks.
- Genre Pages: Create pages for different genres (e.g., Rock, Pop, Jazz) that list popular albums or playlists within that genre.
